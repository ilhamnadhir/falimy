# FALIMY üéØ


## Rndom Family Generator
### Team Name: Ilham Nadhir's Team


### Team Members
- Team Member: Ilham Nadhir

### Project Description
Falimy is a playful Flask web app where users enter their name, age, gender, and photo to be paired with a random ‚Äúmother,‚Äù ‚Äúfather,‚Äù and ‚Äúsibling‚Äù from other participants in the database. It stores all entries in SQLite, shows matches in a stylish UI, and includes an admin view for seeing all submissions.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Falimy plays on that quiet ache of not having a family, or not feeling fully connected to one. It takes your name, age, gender, and photo, and fills in the missing spaces with real people, chosen at random, to be your mother, father, and sibling. It‚Äôs not perfect, it‚Äôs not permanent, but for a moment, those empty spots aren‚Äôt empty anymore.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Falimy gives you a family you never knew you had. You share your name, age, gender, and photo, and in seconds, it pairs you with a random mother, father, and sibling from real people around the world. It‚Äôs random, it‚Äôs silly, and somehow‚Ä¶ it feels a little bit special, a reminder that family can be found in the most unexpected places.
